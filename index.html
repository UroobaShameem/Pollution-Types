            <h1>POLLUTION</h1>

            <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. 
                These harmful materials are called pollutants. 
                Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. 
                They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. 
                Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.

                    <h1>AIR POLLUTION</h1> 
                    <p>Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, 
                    physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. 
                    Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are 
                    common sources of air pollution.</p>

                    <h1>WATER POLLUTION</h1>
                    <p>Water pollution is the contamination of water sources by substances which make the water 
                    unusable for drinking, cooking, cleaning, swimming, and other activities. 
                    Pollutants include chemicals, trash, bacteria, and parasites. 
                    All forms of pollution eventually make their way to water.</p>

                    <h1>LAND POLLUTION</h1>
                    <p>Land pollution refers to the deterioration of the earthâ€™s land surfaces, at and below ground level. 
                    The cause is the accumulation of solid and liquid waste materials that contaminate groundwater and soil. 
                    These waste materials includes both hazardous and non-hazardous waste.</p>
